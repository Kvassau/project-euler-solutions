# Project Euler Solutions
Project Euler problem solutions

## Structure
Numbered folders containing their respective solutions and any needed build files

## How To Build/Run
For Windows:
```console
cd <numbered_folder>\<language> && build.bat
```

For Linux/BSD:
```console
cd <numbered_folder>/<language> && ./build.sh
```
All shell scripts should be POSIX sh compliant 

If successful, the build script output will specify the output binary and usage, for example:
```console
"1.exe" built successfully
Usage: "1 <number>" e.g. "1 456"
```
or
```console
"1.bin" built successfully
Usage: "./1.bin <number>" e.g. "./1.bin 456"
```
